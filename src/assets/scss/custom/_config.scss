 * Any variables you find set in this framework's `core/_config-defaults.scss` that you do not wish to
 * keep, simply redefine here. This means that if this framework, for example, sets
 * your `$fs-base` at 16px and you wish it to be 14px, simply redeclare
 * that variable in font-sizes-and-layout file. this framework ignores its own variables in favour of
 * using your own, so you can completely modify how this framework works without ever
 * having to alter the framework itself.
